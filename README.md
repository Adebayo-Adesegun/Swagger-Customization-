# Swagger-Customization

### This project is a boiler template to integrate swagger in an Asp.Net core web project. 

#### You replace the url in script.js for the generated swagger.json link.  

_In this example template, the json link generated for the pet store store official example for 
swagger was used @https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json from @https://petstore.swagger.io/. 

_The swagger.ui files were downloaded from https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/download/. 
The files were necessary to aid full customization of the displayed output. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The official layout template for Asp.net mvc was adopted

You can easily customize and use your own bootstrap template for the project and wrap around the swagger markup section.
