# Swagger-Customization
This project is a web project that customizes swagger for developers...

It takes in the generated swagger.json link and embeds it within you codes 

In this example template, the json link generated for the pet store store official example for 
swagger was used @https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json from @https://petstore.swagger.io/. 

The swagger.ui files were downloaded from https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/download/. 
The files were necessary to aid full customization of the displayed output.
