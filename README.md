# Swagger-Customization
This project is an Asp.Net core web project that customizes swagger for developers...

It takes in the generated swagger.json link and embeds it within your markup.  

In this example template, the json link generated for the pet store store official example for 
swagger was used @https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json from @https://petstore.swagger.io/. 

The swagger.ui files were downloaded from https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/download/. 
The files were necessary to aid full customization of the displayed output.

Regna bootstrap 4 free template was downloaded from https://bootstrapmade.com/wp-content/themefiles/Regna/Regna.zip

You can easily customize and use your own bootstrap template for the project and wrap around the swagger markup section.
