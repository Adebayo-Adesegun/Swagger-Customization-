# Swagger-Customization

### This project is a boiler template to integrate swagger in an Asp.Net core web project. 

#### Replace the url in script.js for the generated swagger.json link.  

_In this example template, the json link generated for the pet store store official example for 
swagger was used @https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json from @https://petstore.swagger.io/ which can easily replace from the swagger.json link generated in your API project.  

_The swagger.ui files were downloaded from https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/download/. 

### The files were necessary to aid full customization of the displayed output. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The official layout template for Asp.net mvc was adopted

You can easily customize and use your own bootstrap template (or create custom design) for the project and wrap around the swagger markup section. 


### The project was stripped of all dependencies asides those of swagger.
